              <li>I have many quilts by Becky Wilcox! I am in California and so they(the quilts) take the trip and come back with wonderful results!   I trust Becky's judgement and I have never been disappointed!  We connected on Facebook and actually went to high school together way back when!  So it is fun to do business now and I recommend her highly!</li>
