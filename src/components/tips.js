              <h2 className = "tips-text"> One of the problems as a longarm quilter that I run into fairly often are borders that flare or have extra bfabric in them.  Do I make a tuck? So I cut into the border and remove some of the fabric?  How can I quilt that flat???  Proper measuring is the answer.  Each time you add any border to the cneter of your quilt, follow the quidlines in the example below.  You will have a uch happiier longarm quilter, no headaches for her and your quilt will lokk so much nicer.</h2>
              <h2 className = "tips-text">To pre-wash or not to pre-wash?  That is the quiestion.   there are many opinions on theat subject.  Mine has changedsince I began quilting.  When I bagan quilting, I never pre-washed.  It simplified things and I think I was a bit lazy.  I also loved that crisp feel of the fabric.  But since I have been pre-washing the fabric, my quilts have been so much more accureate.  I saw this proven in a class I went to.  The teacher showed samples of a simple nine patch block on a measuring grid.  The pre-washed fabric was right on the lines, nearly perfect.  The non-pre washed fabric wobbled and waved a bit.  And we all know that if the inaccuracies continue, they get bigger as the quilt gets bigger.  The end product is a less than square quilt.  To get the crispness back into your fabric, use a fabric spray such as May Wllen's Bes Press.  Better yet, make your own.  Mix 1 ounce of vodka, made from potao startch, with 8 ounces of distilled water.  Voila! Your own pressing agent and dfor pennies too!</h2>
